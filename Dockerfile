# --- [THE FINAL, PRODUCTION-READY COMMAND] ---
# This is the command that will be executed when the container starts.
# It uses `sh -c` to run a sequence of commands.
# 1. `alembic upgrade head`: This command runs the database migrations. It ensures
#    the database schema is up-to-date with the code before the app starts.
#    If migrations fail, the `&&` ensures the server will NOT start, preventing crashes.
# 2. `exec gunicorn ...`: The `exec` command replaces the shell process with the Gunicorn
#    process. This is a best practice that ensures signals (like shutdown commands
#    from Railway) are properly handled by the application server.
#    - `-k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker`: Specifies the high-performance Uvicorn worker class.
#    - `-w 4`: Sets the number of worker processes (a good starting point).
#    - `-b 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8080}`: Binds the server to all available network interfaces on the
#      port specified by the `$PORT` environment variable (standard for hosting platforms)
#      OR defaults to 8080 if `$PORT` is not set (for local Docker runs).
#    - `app.main:app`: Points to the FastAPI application instance inside your code.
