# Multi-Model AI Grading System - Requirements Analysis

## Original Requirements Addressed

This document maps each requirement from the problem statement to the implemented solution.

### Requirement 1: Multi-Model AI Grading with Consensus

**Original Request:**
> "Instead of 1 AI model, which is gemini 2.5 flash, we use 3 AI model gemini 2.5 flash which all have same prompt(maybe we can run them as loop) but we keep their output in 3 different place, and then we compare for each single question which is it 2 of 3 model are giving same mark for a question or no"

**✅ Implementation:**

**Files Modified/Created:**
- `app/services/multi_model_ai.py` - Concurrent 3-model calls
- `app/services/ai_consensus.py` - Consensus evaluation logic
- `app/services/assessment_helpers/grading_pipeline.py` - Updated pipeline
- `app/services/assessment_service.py` - Multi-model integration

**Key Code:**
```python
# Concurrent 3-model execution
async def generate_multi_model_responses(prompt: str, images: List[Image.Image]) -> List[Dict]:
    tasks = [
        single_model_call("gemini_1"),
        single_model_call("gemini_2"), 
        single_model_call("gemini_3")
    ]
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return responses

# Consensus evaluation (2/3 majority rule)
def evaluate_consensus(ai_responses: List[Dict], question_id: str):
    # Full consensus: All 3 agree → "ai_graded"  
    # Majority consensus: 2/3 agree → "ai_graded"
    # No consensus: All different → "pending_review"
```

**Database Storage:**
```python
# New fields in Result model
ai_responses = Column(JSON, nullable=True)      # All 3 AI responses stored
consensus_achieved = Column(String, nullable=True)  # "full", "majority", "none"
```

### Requirement 2: Categorized Results (AI-graded vs Pending Review)

**Original Request:**
> "so in the result page, we should have 2 part for students, first the students that is fully marked by AI And another part that is pending for review"

**✅ Implementation:**

**API Endpoint:**
```http
GET /assessments/{job_id}/results/categorized
```

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "ai_graded_students": [
    {"id": "student1", "name": "John", "answerSheetPath": "..."}
  ],
  "pending_review_students": [
    {"id": "student2", "name": "Jane", "answerSheetPath": "..."}  
  ]
}
```

**Service Method:**
```python
def get_categorized_job_results(self, job_id: str, user_id: str):
    # Categorize students based on result status
    for student in class_students:
        student_results = [r for r in all_results if r.student_id == student.id]
        has_pending = any(r.status == "pending_review" for r in student_results)
        
        if has_pending:
            pending_review_students.append(student_data)
        else:
            ai_graded_students.append(student_data)
```

### Requirement 3: Teacher Review Page

**Original Request:**
> "we should make a new page also that be review of ai graded, which should contain the questions, the students answers for each question, and ai mark and ai comment, and all be editable by teacher"

**✅ Implementation:**

**API Endpoint:**
```http
GET /assessments/{job_id}/review/{student_id}
```

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "pending_questions": [
    {
      "question": {"id": "q1", "text": "...", "maxScore": 10},
      "student_answer": "Student's written answer...",
      "result": null  // No AI consensus
    }
  ],
  "ai_graded_questions": [
    {
      "question": {"id": "q2", "text": "...", "maxScore": 10},
      "student_answer": "Student's written answer...",
      "result": {
        "grade": 8.5,
        "feedback": "AI feedback...",
        "ai_responses": [
          {"model_id": "gemini_1", "grade": 8.5, "feedback": "..."},
          {"model_id": "gemini_2", "grade": 8.5, "feedback": "..."},
          {"model_id": "gemini_3", "grade": 8.0, "feedback": "..."}
        ],
        "consensus_achieved": "majority"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Service Method:**
```python
def get_student_review_data(self, job_id: str, student_id: str, user_id: str):
    # Separate questions by status
    if question_result and question_result.status == "pending_review":
        pending_questions.append(question_data)
    else:
        ai_graded_questions.append(question_data)
```

### Requirement 4: Pending Review Interface  

**Original Request:**
> "in this review page, if a question mark as pending review, then teacher should easily access to pending questions (maybe in top of the new page) and it should contain question and students answer, but no mark and comment from AI, but have a place so teacher can add mark and comment and then submit and it should be then mark as teacher-graded"

**✅ Implementation:**

**API Endpoint:**
```http
PATCH /assessments/{job_id}/review/{student_id}/{question_id}/pending
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "grade": 8.5,
  "feedback": "Good work, but missed concept X"
}
```

**Service Method:**
```python
def submit_teacher_review(self, job_id: str, student_id: str, question_id: str, 
                        grade: float, feedback: str, user_id: str):
    # Update result with teacher's grade and change status
    self.db.update_student_result_with_grade(
        job_id=job_id, student_id=student_id, question_id=question_id,
        grade=grade, feedback=feedback, status="teacher_graded", user_id=user_id
    )
```

**Frontend Integration:**
- Pending questions displayed at **top** of review page
- Shows question text and student answer
- **No AI marks/comments** shown (as requested)
- Form for teacher to input grade and feedback
- Submit button changes status to `teacher_graded`

### Requirement 5: Auto-Save and Report Regeneration

**Original Request:**
> "when teacher want to come out of the review page, if any change happen, it should be save and make a new report for student based on the changed that teacher applied"

**✅ Implementation:**

**Auto-Save Endpoints:**
```http
PATCH /assessments/{job_id}/review/{student_id}/{question_id}/override  # AI grade overrides
PATCH /assessments/{job_id}/review/{student_id}/{question_id}/pending   # Pending reviews
```

**Report Regeneration:**
```http
POST /assessments/{job_id}/regenerate-reports
```

**Service Method:**
```python
def save_teacher_override(self, job_id: str, student_id: str, question_id: str, 
                        override_data: TeacherOverride, user_id: str):
    # Save teacher override with timestamp
    teacher_override = {
        "grade": override_data.grade,
        "feedback": override_data.feedback, 
        "timestamp": datetime.datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "original_ai_grade": current_result.grade,
        "original_ai_feedback": current_result.feedback
    }
    # Update database with override
```
