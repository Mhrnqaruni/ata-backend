"""
This module contains specialist helper functions for the initial creation of an
assessment job.

It is called by the main `assessment_service` and is responsible for:
1. Handling the physical saving of uploaded answer sheet files to disk.
2. Creating the initial `Assessment` and placeholder `Result` records in the
   database, ensuring that the new `Assessment` record is correctly stamped
   with the owner's `user_id`.
