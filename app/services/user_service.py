"""
This service module encapsulates all business logic related to user management.

It acts as an intermediary between the API endpoints (routers) and the raw
database operations, ensuring a clean separation of concerns. The functions
in this module are responsible for:
- Retrieving users from the database.
- Orchestrating the creation of new users, including password hashing.
- Authenticating users by verifying their credentials.
