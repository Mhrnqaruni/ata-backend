1.  **Target Audience:** All questions MUST be aligned with the specified **Grade Level**: `{grade_level}`.
2.  **Source Material:** All questions MUST be derived directly from the **Source Text**.
3.  **[CRITICAL] Pedagogical Focus:** All questions MUST assess understanding of the core educational concepts within the source text. You are strictly forbidden from generating trivial questions about the text's formatting, publication details, or any "meta" content. For example, DO NOT ask questions like "What is the access code for this book?" or "On which page is the glossary?". Focus ONLY on the learning material.
4.  **EXECUTE THE PLAN:** You have been given a **Question Generation Plan** detailing the exact types, counts, and difficulty levels of questions to create. You MUST follow this plan exactly.
5.  **DIFFICULTY:** You MUST adjust the complexity, cognitive demand, and nuance of each question to match its specified difficulty level.
6.  **Answer Key:** You MUST provide a separate "Answer Key" section at the very end of your output, formatted with a `## Answer Key` header.

11. **Answer Distribution:** You MUST ensure a balanced and random distribution of correct answers for objective questions. For multiple-choice, the correct option (A, B, C, D) should be varied. For True/False, the number of true and false statements should be approximately equal.

    *   `"grade"` (number): The final numerical score for that question.
    *   `"feedback"` (string): The detailed, rubric-based feedback for that question.
8. if for a question, the answer is totally wrong, give it 0, if its half wrong give the half of the score(in default be 50) and if its partially correct give 1/4 or 3/4 of full score based on correctness and wrongness. be like a very good teacter that take care of eveything in details

# --- [PROMPT FOR V2 DOCUMENT-FIRST WORKFLOW - FINAL INTELLIGENT VERSION] ---
DOCUMENT_PARSING_PROMPT = """
You are an expert in educational materials and document analysis. Your task is to analyze the following document(s) and structure them into a specific JSON format.

**--- PRIMARY DIRECTIVE & RULES ---**

1.  **YOUR GOAL:** Identify all distinct sections and questions from the "Question Document Text". You must then identify the correct answer for each question, primarily using the "Answer Key Document Text" if it is provided.
2.  **SOURCE OF TRUTH:** You may be given IMAGES and extracted text. The IMAGES are the primary source of truth. Use the extracted text as a guide, but trust the IMAGE if they differ.

# --- [THE FIX IS HERE: MORE EXPLICIT DUAL-DOCUMENT LOGIC] ---
3.  **DUAL DOCUMENT LOGIC:**
    *   You MUST process the "Question Document Text" first to get a list of all questions.
    *   Then, you MUST iterate through that list of questions. For each question, use its number (e.g., "Question 1", "1.", "a)") to find the corresponding answer in the "Answer Key Document Text".
    *   If the "Answer Key Document Text" is provided, you MUST populate the `"answer"` field in your JSON output with the text you find.
    *   **CRITICAL RUBRIC RULE:** If the "Answer Key Document Text" is provided, you MUST also copy the extracted answer into the `"rubric"` field for that question. This provides a clear guide for the teacher.
    *   If the "Answer Key Document Text" is empty or not provided, you must attempt to extract both answers and rubrics from the "Question Document Text" itself. If no rubric is found, use an empty string.
# --- [END OF FIX] ---

4.  **SCORING METHOD & OTHER FIELDS:** You must infer the scoring method, sections, questions (with text, rubric, maxScore), and answers, and format them into the required JSON structure.
5.  **CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT:** Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any introductory text, concluding remarks, or wrap the JSON in markdown backticks.
6.  **CRITICAL JSON STRUCTURE:** You MUST adhere to the following JSON schema with EXACTLY these key names:
    - The root object must have a `scoringMethod`, `totalScore`, `sections`, and `includeImprovementTips`.
    - Each object in the `sections` array must have a `title`, `total_score`, and `questions`.
    - Each object in the `questions` array MUST have the keys: `"text"`, `"rubric"`, `"maxScore"`, `"answer"`.
7. for all the question by default put the max score 100 

**--- EXAMPLE OF REQUIRED JSON OUTPUT STRUCTURE ---**
{{
  "scoringMethod": "per_question",
  "totalScore": null,
  "sections": [ ... ],
  "includeImprovementTips": false
}}

**--- DOCUMENT CONTEXT ---**

*   **Question Document Text:**

*   **Answer Key Document Text (Optional):**
    ---
    {answer_key_document_text}

**--- REQUIRED OUTPUT (VALID JSON OBJECT ONLY) ---**

Analyze the provided document(s) and/or image(s) now and generate the JSON output, strictly following the specified JSON structure and key names.
