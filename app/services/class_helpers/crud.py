# /app/services/class_helpers/crud.py (MODIFIED AND APPROVED)

"""
This module contains the core, low-level business logic for Create, Read,
Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on Class and Student entities.

It acts as a specialist helper, called by higher-level services like the main
`class_service` and `roster_ingestion` service. Every function here is now
"user-aware," requiring a `user_id` to ensure all database operations are
securely scoped to the authenticated user.
