# /ata-backend/app/main.py (SUPERVISOR-APPROVED FLAWLESS VERSION)

"""
This module is the main entry point and central assembler for the ATA Backend FastAPI application.

It is responsible for:
1. Creating the main FastAPI application instance.
2. Configuring application-wide settings, such as CORS middleware.
3. Managing application lifecycle events (startup and shutdown) via the `lifespan` manager.
4. Importing and including all the API routers from the `app.routers` package,
   effectively building the complete API structure.
