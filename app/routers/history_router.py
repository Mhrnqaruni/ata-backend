"""
This module defines the API endpoints for managing a user's AI generation history.

As a protected resource, every endpoint in this router requires a valid JWT
for access. The `get_current_active_user` dependency is injected into each
endpoint to act as a security gate. This router is responsible for receiving
authenticated requests and passing the user's context (their unique ID) down to
the business logic layer in the `history_service`.
