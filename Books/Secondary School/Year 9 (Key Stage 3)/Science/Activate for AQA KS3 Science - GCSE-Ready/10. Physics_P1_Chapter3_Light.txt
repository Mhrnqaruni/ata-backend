and diffuse scattering:
Your brain uses the fact that light travels in straight lines to work
out where the light appears to come from This is where you see
the image:
When you look at your mirror image in a flat; or plane; mirror; it is
the same shape and size as you are:
It appears to be as far behind
the mirror as you are in front of the mirror: Left and right
appear swapped.
The law of reflection
You know that you need light to reflect from an object for you to
see it: Light reflects off a mirror in the same way that a wave reflects
off a barrier:
