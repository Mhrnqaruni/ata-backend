How do joints allow you to move?
Your joints need to be strong enough to hold your bones together
but flexible enough to let them move: Different types of joint allow
movement in different directions Three types of joint are:
hinge joints
for movement backwards and forwards; for
example, the knee and elbow
ball-and-socket joints

This is called pollination and is caused by insects or the wind
Pollination can occur between two different plants (cross-
pollination) or between the male and female parts of the same
plant (self-pollination).
