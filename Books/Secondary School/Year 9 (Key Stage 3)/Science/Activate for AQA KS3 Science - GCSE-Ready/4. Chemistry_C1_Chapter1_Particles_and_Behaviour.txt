Animal dispersal
Animals can disperse fruits and seeds in two ways:
internally
animals eat lots of fruit; including tomatoes,
blackberries; and strawberries Fruits are normally brightly
coloured and taste sweet, which attracts animals to them:
These fruits contain seeds with hard coats. This means the seeds
