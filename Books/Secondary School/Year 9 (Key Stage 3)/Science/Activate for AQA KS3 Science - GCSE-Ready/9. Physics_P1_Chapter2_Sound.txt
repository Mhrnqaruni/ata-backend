In physics a field is a special region where something experiences
a force. There is a magnetic field around a magnet where magnetic
materials experience a force There are gravitational fields where
things with mass experience a force.

What is the difference between weight and mass?
Weight is a force so it is measured in newtons (N) Mass is the
amount of 'stuff' something is made Up of Itis a measure of how
hard it is to get something to move Mass is measured
in kilograms (kg).
An apple has a
weight of about 1 N.

How do unbalanced forces change speed?
When the car's rocket-powered engine starts up the driving force
will become very big very quickly. When the driver wants to stop he
will fire a parachute to slow the car down: In both cases the forces
on the car are unbalanced.
