Splitting white light
White light is made up of seven different colours of light You can
use a
prism to split white light into a spectrum This is called
dispersion. The spectrum of white light is continuous There
are no gaps between the colours Sir Isaac Newton first did this
experiment in about 1666.
Dispersion happens because different colours of light are refracted
A

You can make all the colours of light from just three colours: red,
