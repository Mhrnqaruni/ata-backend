INTRODUCTION TO THE COURSE
This book has been written to help all students taking the Edexcel International GCSE English Language A (4EA1) 
(first examination June 2018). It is designed to enable them to achieve their full potential during the course and in 
the examination. It is written for both students and teachers. There are two specifications for the International GCSE 
examination, English Language A (4EA1) and English Language B (4EB1). Specification A of the International GCSE 
has two routes, one assessed entirely through examination and one that includes coursework. This book will prepare 
students for all aspects of the course. 
STUDENTS
How will this book support you? We hope you will find it:
 
◼
useful in terms of developing your skills and techniques fully for the Edexcel International GCSE in English Language
 
◼
a helpful guide to your study of the selected texts from the Edexcel Anthology for the International GCSE
 
◼
a support in preparing for unseen passages (all specifications).
This book will also assist in writing the coursework and planning revision. 
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS
The book goes through the requirements for specification A, with explanations, suggestions and questions. It also 
includes a large number of practical activities and examples. These are for practice and will also help you to appreciate 
how really good answers are written and structured.
HINT
Remember to plan your work. The sooner you organise yourself and your ideas, the easier you will find your preparation for every section of 
the examination! This book aims to give you confidence by improving your skills and techniques. You know you can succeed. 
KNOW YOUR TEXTS
It is very important to make sure that you have a really good grasp of the selected fiction and non-fiction passages and 
poems from Section A and Section B of the Anthology. Every year, examiners read International GCSE scripts in which 
the candidates write in a way that shows that they do not understand, or have not prepared carefully, the texts that are 
set. Use the relevant sections from this book to strengthen your knowledge of the texts.
USE YOUR SOURCES
An important part of Paper 1 is the testing of your ability to think on your feet when confronted with unfamiliar (unseen) 
prose passages, to show that you have all understood and responded to these and that you can base your own writing 
on the ideas you have met. Work through the ‘Types of text’ chapter in order to ensure that you are ready to read and 
analyse an unseen passage in Paper 1. 
KNOW AND APPLY PROPERLY YOUR TECHNICAL TERMS
Like other subjects, English has a number of technical terms which you may need to use. It is important that you know 
how to use the correct term and that you can spell it. Refer to the subject vocabulary within the margins or the Glossary 
on pages 192–197 to help you. Even more important is that you know how to explain why a particular device is used, 
looking at the writer’s intentions. In the exams, you will always be given credit for explaining the effects of a word or 
phrase, whether or not you use the technical terms, and accurate use of the right terms will make your writing more 
fluent and concise. 
HINT
Make lists of technical terms, write out what you think they mean, then check your definitions against the glossary at the back or the lists of 
subject vocabulary in the margins.

INTRODUCTION
vii
HINT
Use a system such as different coloured cards or sticky notes to put down the key points on each text.
EXPLORE HOW TO IMPROVE THE STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION OF YOUR 
ANSWERS
If you look closely at the model answers that are given at various points throughout this book, this will help you to write 
detailed, successful responses. 
PRESENTING YOUR WORK EFFECTIVELY
How you set out your own writing is important for various reasons. Get into the habit of producing writing that is:
 
◼
neat, regular and clear
 
◼
spelt accurately
 
◼
correctly punctuated
 
◼
set out in clear paragraphs.
Such strengths in your writing will bring many advantages, both in the examination and afterwards.
 
◼
Examiners will form a positive impression of your work.
 
◼
They will be able to read your answer easily; they will not be able to do so if your handwriting is poor or if it is not 
written in proper sentences.
 
◼
How you write, as well as what you write, will be considered when your work is marked.
 
◼
Good writing is useful for applications for jobs or college courses.
 
◼
Many jobs need people who can write clearly, accurately and precisely.
KNOWING YOUR OWN STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES
It is an excellent idea to keep a checklist of your most common errors in spelling, punctuation and grammar, since these 
are assessed in all specifications. When you receive a piece of work back from your teacher, read it through and make 
sure you understand any comments or corrections.
 
◼
Keep a sheet of file paper at the front or back of your work file and write the correct spelling of words you have 
misspelt on it.
 
◼
Refer to this before handing in your work, to make sure you have not made the same mistakes.
 
◼
Take some time to learn the spellings and other points on your list.
▼ REMEMBER!
 
◼
Make the best use of lesson time.
 
◼
Make sure you know what you have to do in class.
 
◼
Be sure you understand what the homework is.
 
◼
For Coursework route: check what your coursework 
assignments are.
▼ TAKE PART!
 
◼
Ask questions in class.
 
◼
Answer questions in class.
 
◼
Contribute to discussion.
 
◼
Be fully involved in group work. Don’t let others do all the 
talking!
▼ MAKE NOTES!
 
◼
Write down key points from: teachers; books you read; 
class work; articles or worksheets.
 
◼
For International GCSE Specification A or the Certificate: 
annotate your copy of the Anthology carefully.
 
◼
Add points missed onto the end of your homework or 
practice questions when they are returned to you.
▼ KEEP UP!
 
◼
Hand work in on time.
 
◼
Keep files or exercise books up to date.
 
◼
Make sure you do not get behind with your homework.
 
◼
Do not leave work unfinished. It is always difficult to remember 
what has been missed unless you amend it at the time.
 
◼
Check off completed work in your records
▼ SEEK HELP!
 
◼
Ask teachers to explain if you are unsure.
 
◼
Discuss with friends.
 
◼
Look things up using dictionaries, encyclopaedias and the 
Internet.
▼ BE ORGANISED!
 
◼
Have clear systems.
 
◼
Present work neatly.
 
◼
Set yourself targets.
 
◼
Stick to deadlines.

TEXT ANALYSIS SKIMMING FOR THE MAIN IDEA OR THEME
TEXT ANALYSIS SKIMMING FOR THE MAIN IDEA OR THEME
It can be difficult to know where to start when approaching a text 
for the first time. To be confident in handling new texts, you need 
a methodical approach that allows you to understand the main 
ideas that are being communicated. 
Skimming and scanning are two important reading techniques. 
They are often confused with one another but they are very 
different skills, though both help you to achieve the same aim: to 
read more quickly and effectively. 
LESSON OBJECTIVES
SKIMMING AND SCANNING
▶
This lesson will help you to
◼   understand the main ideas 
that a writer is communicating
◼   summarise the key points of a 
text quickly
◼   build confidence in  
independent reading 
SKIMMING
This is useful when you want to get a general idea of what a text is about in 
a short space of time. It means looking through material quickly for a sense 
of the topic and the ideas and information being conveyed. When you skim, 
you read through an article three to four times faster than when you read 
each word. 
WHEN SHOULD I SKIM? 
◼   When reading non-fiction texts
◼   When you have a lot to read in a short space of time
◼   When revising topics to identify key information
◼   To locate and identify reliable information when researching a topic
◼   To identify what information is not relevant when researching a topic
◼   When you already have some background information about a
particular topic and want to find out something new
SCANNING
Scanning refers to reading through material to find specific information. 
When you scan, you run your eyes over information to pull out specific 
words, phrases, or information. You may not be aware of it but you scan 
many types of material in your daily life, from the television guide to the 
football results in the newspaper.
WHEN SHOULD I SCAN?  
◼   When looking for specific pieces of information quickly
◼   To locate a relevant quotation or section in a literature text
TEST YOURSELF!
SKIMMING OR SCANNING? 
Read the following examples and identify which describes the process of 
skimming, and which describes scanning.  
1  You flick through a financial report to find a particular set of data. 
2  You quickly go through a twenty-page report in a few minutes, and 
determine the overall subject, tone, and a few key points. 
3  You pick up a newspaper at a coffee shop, look over the first few pages, 
and gather some general information about the events happening in 
the world. 
4  You open a local newspaper, find the section advertising rooms for rent, 
and then mark a few advertisements in your desired location within your 
price range.
KEY POINTS
What you read is more important than 
what you leave out.
SKIMMING AND SKIPPING
SKIMMING OR SCANNING? 
To skim effectively, you don’t read everything – you must skip, too. So what 
material should you read and what should you leave out? These reading 
strategies for active reading should help you:
1  Highlight key points.
2  Consider each paragraph by rephrasing the first point of each in your      
own words.
3  Underline any unfamiliar words. Can you use the context of the sentence to 
help you establish their meaning? If not, use a dictionary to help you. 
STRATEGIES FOR SKIMMING 
Read the first sentences of each paragraph (this is called the topic 
sentence) – this will give you a good sense of the ideas and structure of 
the text.
Read the first and last paragraphs. 
Some pieces of writing have headings and subheadings. These are a 
useful guide to the information being communicated. 
STRATEGIES FOR SCANNING 
For scanning to be successful, you need to be sure of your purpose, ie 
what information you are looking for, before you begin. 
You should consider the structure of the text. Is it arranged alphabetically, 
by category, chronologically (in time order) or in another way? 
You can use your index finger to help you to identify key information, for 
example, a train or bus time. Move it down the text with your eyes to 
maintain focus.

◼   so full of grief after 
Romeo’s banishment that she 
dies.
Benvolio is:
◼    a good friend of Romeo 
and his cousin
◼    a different kind of man 
from Mercutio and Tybalt – 
he is neutral and fair
◼    keen to stop the fighting 
between the families; a 
peace-maker
◼    someone who, as his 
Italian name suggests 
(translated as ‘wishing 
well’ in English), wants the 
best outcome
◼    a reliable go-between 
for the Montagues and 
Escalus.
Lord Montague is:
◼    the father of Romeo
◼    head of the Montague 
family
◼    the person who reports his 
wife’s death.
Tybalt is:
◼    the cousin of Juliet
◼    a very aggressive 
character
◼    interested in picking fights 
with the Montagues
◼   full of hatred and anger.
Mercutio is:
◼    the best friend of Romeo, 
to whom he is very loyal
◼    intelligent, quick and 
clever; a strong character 
with strong opinions
◼    someone who likes a joke 
and likes to make fun of 
people, including Romeo
◼    always looking for a fight, 
which leads to his death.
GENERAL VOCABULARY
banishment the act of sending someone 
away permanently from their country or 
the area where they live, especially as an 
official punishment 
The Friar is:
◼    a religious figure who acts 
out of concern for Romeo
◼    able to offer Romeo advice 
because he knows him 
very well
◼    someone who seems wise 
and knowledgeable and is 
trusted
◼    brave, as he is prepared to 
suggest a very risky plan 
that does not work out 
well; he could be blamed 
by some for the deaths of 
Romeo and Juliet
◼    a schemer, who has a plan 
to end the feud between 
the families, based on the 
plan he offers Juliet.
You can learn a great deal about the different characters by studying a 
particular scene in detail. A good example is the central scene (Act 3, 
Scene 1) in which Romeo kills Tybalt.
Working with a partner, in a group or by yourself, think about and make 
notes on the following points.
◼   What happened in the previous scene, and therefore what
mood is set for the audience.
◼   The signs that a fight is starting.
◼   Whether the fighting and killing are presented as inevitable.
◼   Links with the fight at the start of the play.
◼   How the audience feels about Romeo at the end of the scene.
◼   How the scene sets up the characters for the next scene.
(How does it relate to the preceding and following scenes?)
◼   How the end of the scene relates to the earlier fight and the
warning from the Prince in Act 1.
▼  CONSIDERING CHARACTER
ACTIVITY 3
AO1
LOVE
Many plays, including those of Shakespeare, look at different types of love. 
We are introduced to Romeo as someone whose feelings for Rosaline might 
be called infatuation; he is immediately shown as completely love-struck, 
but the superficiality of his feelings is underlined by the speed with which he 
abandons them at the sight of Juliet.
The play gives several examples of close friendship as a form of love, 
particularly the protective love shown by the Nurse to Juliet and the Friar to 
Romeo; as well as the ‘laddish’ friendships of the young men, which are still 
instantly recognisable in any street in Italy today, and marked by what the 
Italians themselves call braggadocio (a kind of boastful swagger). However, 
such friendship can generate fierce loyalty, to the point of being willing to die 
for one’s friend, as happens with Mercutio.
MARRIAGE
There is also the view in 17th–century society that marriage is above all a 
business contract, in which love is not a very important consideration: Paris 
wishes to marry Juliet, but admits that he has ‘little talked of love’, and even 
Juliet, when asked how she feels about the idea of marriage to Paris, only says 
‘I’ll look to like’, showing that she has little emotional investment in the idea, 
but will simply try the idea. 
SEX AND SEXUAL REFERENCES
Part of the overall treatment of love is that of sexual love. Although, clearly, the 
marriage of Romeo and Juliet is happily consummated, many of the references 
to sex are not directly linked to their love. Instead they are there to provide 
an endless source of complicated puns and witticisms, particularly for the 
young men and in some instances for the Nurse. Such jesting treats love in an 
altogether more basic way than the idealism of the central relationship.

READING SKILLS
TEXT ANALYSIS
4
It can be difficult to know where to start when approaching a text 
for the first time. You need a methodical approach that allows you 
to understand the main ideas that are being communicated. 
 
Skimming and scanning are two important reading techniques. 
They are often confused with one another, but they are very 
different skills. However, both help you to achieve the same aim: 
to read more quickly and effectively. 
SKIMMING AND SCANNING
▶
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
 
◼
understand the main ideas 
that a writer is communicating
 
◼
summarise the key points of a 
text quickly
 
◼
build confidence in 
independent reading. 
SKIMMING
Skimming is useful when you want to quickly get a general idea of what a 
text is about. When you skim, you read through the text three to four times 
faster than when you read each word in order to get a sense of the topic, 
ideas and information being conveyed.
WHEN SHOULD I SKIM? 
 
◼
When you have a lot to read in a short space of time.
 
◼
When revising topics to identify key information.
 
◼
When locating a passage in a text.
 
◼
To find relevant material when planning an essay.
SCANNING
Scanning refers to reading through material to find specific information. 
When you scan, you run your eyes over the information in a text and pull 
out specific words, phrases or pieces of information. You may not realise, 
but you scan through different texts every day, from television guides to 
football results.
WHEN SHOULD I SCAN? 
 
◼
When looking for specific pieces of information quickly.
 
◼
To locate a relevant quotation or section in a literature text.
HINT
To skim effectively, you don’t read 
everything. What you read is more 
important than what you skip. Try to:
 
◼
highlight key points
 
◼
rephrase the main point of each 
paragraph in your own words
 
◼
underline any unfamiliar words. 
KEY POINT
Skimming and scanning are important 
reading techniques. Skimming is 
reading quickly to get a general sense 
of a text. Scanning involves looking 
through a text for specific information.
Read the following examples and identify which describes the process 
of skimming and which describes scanning. 
1 You flick through a financial report to find a particular set of data. 
2 You quickly go through a twenty-page report in a few minutes to 
determine the overall subject, tone and a few key points. 
3 You pick up a newspaper at a coffee shop, look over the first few 
pages and gather some general information about the events 
happening in the world.

◼
Read the topic sentence. This will give you a good sense of the ideas and 
structure of the whole text.
 
◼
Read the first and last paragraphs. 
 
◼
Use chapter names, headings and subheadings as a guide. 
STRATEGIES FOR SKIMMING 
STRATEGIES FOR SCANNING
 
◼
For scanning to be successful, be sure of your purpose. Think about what 
information you are looking for before you begin to scan the text. 
 
◼
Consider how the text is structured. Is it arranged alphabetically, by 
category, chronologically or does it use other devices such as flashback? 
 
◼
Use your index finger to help you, such as when scanning a timetable for a 
train time. Move your finger down the text at the same time as your eyes to 
help you to maintain focus. 
SUBJECT VOCABULARY
topic sentence the first sentence in a 
paragraph
chronologically organised in linear time
flashback a scene in a film, novel, etc. set 
in a time earlier than the main story. Can 
also be used in non-fiction works.
HINT
Use your own words in a summary 
wherever possible. Simply repeating 
sentences from the original text does not 
show that you have understood what the 
writer is communicating.
SKILLS
CREATIVITY, INNOVATION
SKILLS
INITIATIVE
Once you are confident that you understand the text, you need to 
be able to summarise the key points that the writer makes. A good 
summary phrases these points in a concise and clear style. Choose an 
extract and write a summary of it.
▼ SUMMARISING INFORMATION 
ACTIVITY 3 
▼  SKIMMING AND SCANNING RACE
 
▶ How fast are you at finding the information you need?
You need a dictionary, a pen and a piece of paper. Follow the instructions below carefully. 
ACTIVITY 2 
STEP 1
Open the dictionary 
at any page.
STEP 2
Write down the 
page number in the 
margin of a piece of 
paper.
STEP 6
Now swap pieces of 
paper with your partner. 
STEP 7
See who can complete the written list 
with all the words first.
STEP 8
Now write a paragraph that is as short as 
possible and that uses all your partner’s words.
STEP 4
See what word 
you have chosen. 
Write down its (first) 
definition, but NOT 
the word itself.
STEP 5
Repeat the steps 
above until you have 
ten definitions on 
your page.
STEP 3
Close your eyes 
and place your 
finger somewhere 
on the page of the 
dictionary.

▲ A couple on their wedding day.
EXPLICIT MEANING
The picture shows a woman in a dress holding flowers and standing close 
to a man in a suit. 
IMPLICIT MEANING
We may be able to infer that this is a wedding photograph because we 
have experience of seeing this type of image being related to weddings. 
To be a good reader, you need to understand both what a text tells 
you directly, or explicitly, and to infer based on what you think 
the writer indirectly, or implicitly, suggests in their text. This may 
be about the writer’s views, character or theme. 
EXPLICIT AND IMPLICIT MEANING
▶
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
 
◼
interpret the information and 
ideas in a text
 
◼
read between the lines to work 
out what the text implies.
KEY POINT
Explicit meaning is where the writer 
explains their ideas.
Implicit meaning is where the writer 
implies their ideas; you have to infer 
and imagine based on what you know. 
▼  AN EXTRACT FROM A WALK IN THE WOODS  
BY BILL BRYSON
We hiked till five and camped beside a tranquil spring in a small, grassy 
clearing in the trees just off the trail. Because it was our first day back on the 
trail, we were flush for food, including perishables like cheese and bread that 
had to be eaten before they went off or were shaken to bits in our  
packs, so we rather gorged ourselves, then sat around smoking and chatting 
idly until persistent and numerous midgelike creatures (no-see-ums, as they 
are universally known along the trail) drove us into our tents. It was perfect 
sleeping weather, cool enough to need a bag but warm enough that you could 
sleep in your underwear, and I was looking forward to a long night’s snooze 
– indeed was enjoying a long night’s snooze – when, at some indeterminate 
dark hour, there was a sound nearby that made my eyes fly open. Normally, 
I slept through everything – through thunderstorms, through Katz’s snoring 
and noisy midnight pees – so something big enough or distinctive enough to 
wake me was unusual. There was a sound of undergrowth being disturbed 
– a click of breaking branches, a weighty pushing through low foliage – and 
then a kind of large, vaguely irritable snuffling noise.

Bear! 
 
I sat bolt upright. Instantly every neuron in my brain was awake and 
dashing around frantically, like ants when you disturb their nest. I reached 
instinctively for my knife, then realized I had left it in my pack, just outside 
the tent. Nocturnal defense had ceased to be a concern after many successive 
nights of tranquil woodland repose. There was another noise, quite near. 
 
“Stephen, you awake?” I whispered. 
 
“Yup,” he replied in a weary but normal voice. 
 
“What was that?” 
 
“How the hell should I know?” 
 
“It sounded big.” 
 
“Everything sounds big in the woods.” 
 
This was true. Once a skunk had come plodding through our camp and it 
had sounded like a stegosaurus.

pairs, choose a paragraph each and consider the following questions. 
 
▶ What does the narrator tell us about his thoughts and feelings? 
 
▶ Which words and phrases allow us to infer his thoughts and feelings? 
Draw a table with two columns, one for each question, and pick out the 
key words and phrases which convey explicit and implicit meaning.

The P-E-E chain stands for Point-Evidence-Explain. This is the order in which 
you should organise the information in each paragraph that you write.
1 State your basic point clearly and concisely. Your point should be relevant 
to the task or question that you have been set.
2 Demonstrate how you can support your opening statement with reference 
to a specific part of the text that you are writing about. Quotations can 
be used as evidence to support what you are saying and to help you to 
make your point. Try to select words or phrases from the text that precisely 
support your point and keep them as brief as possible. Use inverted 
commas, also known as quotation marks, to indicate where you have used 
words directly from another text.
When writing, it is important to express points in a clear and 
structured way. We organise writing into paragraphs. Each 
paragraph should be self-contained and make sense on its own. 
It should be constructed of a group of sentences which all link to 
the same idea, theme or topic.
POINT EVIDENCE EXPLAIN
▶
 LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to: 
 
◼
organise your ideas and 
structure your writing clearly 
and with direction. 
MAKING THE PERFECT POINT 
HINT
A quotation does not have to be direct 
speech: you can quote evidence from a 
science journal or a famous play in the 
same way.
3 Add an explanation. The first step is to explain how your quotation supports 
the point that you have made so that your reader knows why you have 
included it. In English Language, it is often useful to consider the use of 
language, going into some detail about the writer’s choice of words (this is 
also known as diction) and considering any linguistic devices or techniques 
which have been used. 
PERFECT PUNCTUATION 
Short quotations of a single line or part of a line should be incorporated within 
quotation marks as part of the running text of your essay, ‘just like this’. 
Quotations of two or more full lines should be indented from the main body of 
the text and introduced by a colon, like this:
‘this is how you would quote a longer piece of text, but make sure that it 
is all relevant.’
SUBJECT VOCABULARY
quotations words quoted from a text
quotation marks punctuation marks used 
to indicate where you have quoted, ‘like 
this’
direct speech words spoken by a 
character in a novel, play or poem
diction the writer’s choice of words
PARAGRAPH SANDWICHES
You can think of your paragraph like a sandwich or burger, with three separate 
parts.
Top bun: opening topic sentence
Introduces the paragraph and your 
main idea.
Fillings: supporting sentences
This is the main part. Describe 
and explain your main point 
using quotes and evidence to 
complement and support it.
Bottom bun: closing sentence
A concluding sentence to bring 
everything together

Read this chain paragraph, summarising the novel Of Mice and Men 
by John Steinbeck. Copy the paragraph and colour code or label each 
part of the P-E-E chain. Each part of the chain may be more than one 
sentence.
Set in the Great Depression of the 1930s, the novel tells of the close 
friendship between two farm workers, George and Lennie: ‘I got you 
to look after me, and you got me to look after you.’ The other men 
on the ranch are described as ‘the loneliest guys in the world’ and 
George and Lennie are proud of the fact that they have each other. 
The repetition of the second person pronoun ‘you’ here emphasises 
the close and reciprocal bond between the men. George and Lennie 
often repeat this line to one another when they are talking about 
their dreams for the future and Lennie is always excited when George 
reaffirms their friendship in this way. Their friendship gives them hope 
and joy in a desolate world. 
Using a set text from your English studies, write your own question 
and P-E-E chain paragraph about a character or theme. The following 
questions are examples to help you to construct a question based on 
your own reading.
 
▶ How is the protagonist portrayed in the novel?
 
▶ What is the main theme of the novel?
