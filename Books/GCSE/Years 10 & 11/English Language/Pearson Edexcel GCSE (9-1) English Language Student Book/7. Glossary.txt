ASSIGNMENT A: POETRY AND PROSE TEXTS
In your commentary, you should aim to explain why you chose the two texts 
and talk about interpreting ideals and perspectives in relation to each text. To 
do this, you could adopt the following plan.
 
◼
Explain why you chose the two texts – it is important to show that you 
have thought about which texts to write about, rather than simply done 
what you were told to do. For example, you might say that you were 
interested in them because they both explored aspects of a theme in 
which you are interested. Mention that you have read the other texts in the 
Anthology and why these two were more interesting to write about.
 
◼
Interpreting ideas and perspectives – say something about these in 
relation to each piece about which you have written. For example, if you 
wrote about ‘Still I Rise’, Maya Angelou, you might say that the poem 
is written from the perspective of an intelligent and passionate black 
American girl at a time when the social status of African-Americans was 
finally improving.
If you have worked through the relevant sections on the texts that you have 
chosen, and have understood how to create an effective and perceptive 
answer about your chosen texts, then you should now be ready to plan your 
own piece of coursework. Good luck!

ASSIGNMENT B: IMAGINATIVE WRITING
PAPER 3
The purpose or purposes of your piece of writing should be any or all of the 
following: to explore, to imagine, to entertain. In this way, it is like the imaginative 
writing task set in Section B of Paper 2.
The assignment is worth the same amount as Assignment A, making it worth 
20% of the International GCSE in English Language.
Your teacher will set the question or choice of questions. The topic could be 
suggested by a piece in the Anthology, such as the following question.
 
▶ ‘Free from the chains.’ Write an imaginative piece ending with these words.
Alternatively, it could be an unrelated topic, perhaps relating to an image or 
concept such as the following suggestions.
 
▶ The dream.
 
▶ Anxious moments.
 
▶ The shame of it.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES
This lesson will help you to:
 
◼
understand how to approach 
the imaginative writing element 
of your coursework.
The second assignment is a piece of personal and imaginative 
writing. This will be based on a topic, or topics, that will be given 
to you by your teacher.
ASSIGNMENT B: IMAGINATIVE WRITING 
▶
ELEMENTS OF STORYTELLING
Turn to the Paper 2 chapter on imaginative writing (pages XXX–XXX) and work 
through as many of the activities as you can, particularly the sections on plot, 
structure, vocabulary for effect and sentences for effect. This will focus your 
mind on narrative methods and techniques.
There are three vital goals. You have to demonstrate: firstly, how 
expressively and how appropriately you can write; secondly, how 
effectively you can structure your writing; and finally, how accurately 
you can write in terms of spelling, punctuation and grammar. 
Write a detailed plan for one of the suggested titles above and two 
good opening paragraphs in response to your chosen title.

ASSIGNMENT B: IMAGINATIVE WRITING
1 Write from your own perspective. Why set your story in a small town 
in another country, about which you know little, when there must be 
hundreds of stories near your home that are waiting to be told?
2 Remember you don’t have to be totally truthful, even when writing a story 
based on your own experience; you can imagine and pretend.
3 If you are aiming for the higher grades then you should consider 
presenting your work in a fresh or original way. You need to show skill in 
engaging and keeping your reader’s interest.
4 Experiment with form. For example, try telling a story from different 
angles, from the points of view of different characters.
5 In stories, create characters as well as atmosphere; give them motives. 
Don’t just focus on drama and violence: think of consequences.
Finally, remember:
 
◼
coursework takes careful thought and planning
 
◼
seek advice, but write as yourself in your own words
 
◼
use spell checkers carefully – it is allowed! 
Before you start to plan your own story, here is an example of a piece 
written by a GCSE candidate. Read it and assess it using the mark 
scheme.
ESCAPE
The blade glinted in the light of the half-moon, hanging over the whispy dark 
clouds. Then a piercing beam from a spotlight, or was it headlights, shot 
through the darkness, lighting up trees, bushes and huge muddy puddles 
along the track through the woods. A shadowy figure ducked into the thick 
vegetation. He bent down and sawed at the padlock around a chain circling 
his leg, then, when it fell away onto the ground, he stood up, and went out into 
the cover of the night…
His name was John O’Malley, leutenant – a sniper – the best in the regiment. 
During his escape from the prison camp in Germany, he had managed to 
keep his Lee-Enfield scope under his greatcoat. Just as he was preparing 
to move on swiftly, there was the roar of a vehecle. He ducked into the dark 
ditch, crouching in the dank greenery. Once the lorry was safely out of earshot 
he moved on through the trees, then descended down the frosty slopes to a 
village. If anyone had been watching as he flitted from tree to tree, he would 
have appeared like some woodland creature: but nobody was watching.
The streets were deserted, no-one observed him as he slipped along them. 
Then he muttered to himself: ‘Damn! Just my luck,’ as he came in view  
of a checkpoint. There was nothing else he could do, so, sweating, he

approached and handed his forged papers to the obnoxsious-looking guard. 
He scrutenised them with a bad-tempered expression on his face. Then he 
handed them back. The guard shouted something and the gate lifted. He 
bought a ticket, for he spoke good German, and boarded the train near the 
massive, snorting steam engine. For the first time he felt that he might really 
escape. He almost dared to relax a little, as he settled into a window seat. 
Then suddenly there was a sound of boots and someone shouting ‘Halt! Halt!’ 
as SS soldiers poured onto the train and issued abrupt commands. The exits 
were blocked, one of them asked for his papers, but was not satisfied with 
them. He shouted out some questions and ordered him off the train. John’s 
heart sank, he was back to square one. 
He was shoved into the back of a van with a couple of dangerous-looking 
dogs and various bits of equipment. The door was locked. Drearily, he 
wondered what his chances were of escaping again on the way to the camp, 
or another, tougher camp. At least he was alive, and in one peice, he thought,  
it was something to be grateful for. At least the Germans did not exicute 
escaped prisoners. Not usually, in any case. 
There might be another chance, he told himself, he must stay alert… 
Although this response not perfect, it has many good points.
What marks for AO4 (out of 20) and AO5 (out of 10) do you think this

Uses a wide, selective  
vocabulary with only occasional 
spelling errors.

Positions a range of punctuation 
for clarity, managing sentence 
structures for deliberate effect.
Level 5: 9–10
 
◼
Manipulates complex ideas, 
utilising a range of structural and 
grammatical features to support 
coherence and cohesion.
 
◼
Uses extensive vocabulary 
strategically; rare spelling errors do 
not detract from overall meaning.
 
◼
Punctuates writing with accuracy 
to aid emphasis and precision, 
using a range of sentence 
structures accurately and 
selectively to achieve particular 
effects.
In pairs or individually, copy and complete the following table, dividing 
‘Escape’ into five sections and writing a phrase to sum up the content 
of each section. You could begin by summarising the content of each 
paragraph, bearing in mind that a section may contain more than one 
paragraph.

ASSIGNMENT B: IMAGINATIVE WRITING
PLANNING STRUCTURE 
Answer the following questions about ‘Escape’:
 
▶ Why is it probably best to base your story on one simple incident?
 
▶ Why is it best to have only one or two main characters?
 
▶ A lot of young people writing stories tend to include too many events and 
characters: why do you think this is?
MAKING CHOICES ABOUT 
CONTENT AND GENRE
Another way to think about structure is to plan which types or functions of 
writing you are going to use.
Even though you may only write around 600 words, using several types or 
functions of writing will give your story a sense of variety, which will help to 
keep your reader interested.
These types or functions of writing are:
 
◼
description: many stories begin with brief scene-setting descriptions
 
◼
narrative: this tells us what happens and includes tiny actions and 
movements, such as ‘he frowned’, which are important in storytelling
 
◼
dialogue: speech often brings a story to life and conveys feelings very 
directly and convincingly
 
◼
thoughts and feelings: thoughts that are not included in the dialogue but 
are included when a character is thinking to themselves, which can help to 
give your characters more depth
 
◼
background information: it may be useful to tell the reader something 
about a character or place.
When you are planning, try to bring in several of these – it should help you to 
structure the piece. Even if you decide to have only one character, you may 
find that you can even use dialogue as it can be useful to have your character 
say something to themselves.
1 Using the following checklist, tick the functions of writing that you 
will probably use and write a short note on how you might use each 
one. You could concentrate on using one more than the others if you 
like. For example, your piece could be almost entirely description or 
dialogue: there are no exact rules, though some variety is surely a 
good idea.
 
□
Description
 
□
Narrative
 
□
Dialogue
 
□
Thoughts and feelings
 
□
Background information
2 Go back to ‘Escape’ and read it again. Find examples of each of the 
five functions of writing and label them. Notice how easily the writer 
slips from one function to another, so that the reader does not notice. 
▼  USING TYPES OF WRITING TO PLAN STRUCTURE
ACTIVITY 4 
KEY POINT
You can structure your writing around 
functions such as narrative, or 
dialogue. Not only does this maintain 
the reader’s interest, it also provides a 
framwork around which you can fill out 
the piece.

HINT
‘Escape’ has: one main character; two 
or three clear settings; a simple (though 
dramatic) situation; two incidents; a 
difficult problem; and an ending that was 
conclusive for the time being, though it left 
a cliffhanger. In other words, it contained 
more than enough for 400–500 words. 
Don’t try to include too many characters or 
too many events – focus on one incident or 
one problem.
What type of story have you found easiest, or perhaps most enjoyable, to write 
in the past? Choose two from the list below.
Genre:
 
◼
sci-fi
 
◼
fantasy
 
◼
war
 
◼
romance
 
◼
comedy
 
◼
thriller
 
◼
horror
 
◼
realism.
Because the title that you will be given will normally be one or two very general 
words, it is likely that you will be able to relate the title to any genre. Imagine 
that the title that you have been given is ‘The Decision’. Choose one of the two 
genres that you selected from the list and jot down some ideas for a story in 
that genre with that title. You could do this in a list or spider diagram. Include 
details about:
 
◼
the main character 
 
◼
the setting
 
◼
the situation 
 
◼
the central incident or event
 
◼
a problem to solve 
 
◼
the ending.
However long or short, all stories will have a beginning, a middle and 
an end. The beginning should preferably have a narrative hook that 
makes the reader want to read on (for example, in ‘Escape’, we wanted 
to know who he was and what he was escaping from). The ending need 
not be a full conclusion, especially in a very short story, but it should 
give the reader some sense of resolution.
▼  BEGINNING, MIDDLE AND END
ACTIVITY 5 
Summarise how you think your story will begin, develop and end. 
When you finish writing your story, compare your original plan with the 
finished story. What has changed? What worked out as you expected?

ASSIGNMENT B: IMAGINATIVE WRITING
The following spider diagram is a plan for a simple realistic story entitled ‘The 
Decision’
Characters: Ant is quieter than others; one 
of the new members is seen in distance but 
they don’t meet him – reactions to him?
Describe: setting 
near school – street
Decides at end to go 
with them, but might 
leave early – he tells 
best friend – reaction in 
dialogue
Narrative – Meets one 
or two friends – walks 
with them? later on 
his own thinks about 
problem
Dialogue and thoughts 
or feelings
Situation: 15-year-old boy; problem 
– is he going to go out with a group of 
friends, though he doesn’t much like one 
or two new members, and he is worried 
that they will get them into trouble 
[how?]
This example is based on a very simple situation that may be familiar to you. 
A lot of writers advise beginners to ‘write about what you know’, and this often 
makes sense. An idea such as this might be one in which you can draw on 
your own experience, and alter it as much as you like, and this will help you to 
make the writing vivid and believable. However, you can see that a title such 
as ‘The Decision’ could work in any genre at all. 
Part of the planning process will involve thinking about your main character. 
It is a good idea to tell the story from this character’s point of view, as this 
will give the reader a strong sense of their personality. One of the things you 
should decide quite quickly is whether to tell the story in the first or third 
person. First person narrative is best if you want the reader to see everything 
from your main character’s point of view, whereas third person narrative is best 
if you want the reader to understand everything via an all-knowing narrator. 
Once you have chosen your narrative perspective, copy and complete the 
following table, filling it out with details about your main character.
Gender
 
Age
 
Ethnicity
 
Where from originally?
 
Living where (if different)?
 
Outgoing/shy?
 
Clever/average?
 
Pleased about what in life?
 
Upset about what in life?
 
How do they dress?
 
Class background?
 
What objects would you associate with them  
(to do with work/hobbies/interests etc.)?
 
Problem in story?
